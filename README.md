Api Used : https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment When a user clicks the "display" button and selects a grouping option, the Kanban board should dynamically adjust to reflect the user's choice.

The application should offer three distinct ways to group the data:

By Status: Group tickets based on their current status.
By User: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
By Priority: Group tickets based on their priority level.
Users should also be able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:
#Kanban Board React

Priority: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
Title: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.
The Kanban board should be responsive and visually appealing, with a design similar to the provided screenshots.

The priority levels for the tickets are as follows:

Urgent (Priority level 4)
High (Priority level 3)
Medium (Priority level 2)
Low (Priority level 1)
No priority (Priority level 0)
Priority levels: (This values you will receive in the api)

4 - Urgent

3 - High

2 - Medium

1 - Low

0 - No priority

Additionally, the application should save the user's view state even after page reload.
